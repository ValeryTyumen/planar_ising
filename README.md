# planar_ising

Inference and sampling of planar and near-planar zero-field Ising models

Implementation of the paper "Inference and Sampling of K33-free Ising Models", Valerii Likhosherstov, Yury Maximov, Michael Chertkov. https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.09587, accepted to ICML 2019.

To generate plots from the paper add `planar_ising` to `$PYTHONPATH` and run `tests/k33_free_tests.py`. Tested under Python 3.6.4 from Anaconda distribution, NumPy 1.13.3 and Numba 0.37.0.
